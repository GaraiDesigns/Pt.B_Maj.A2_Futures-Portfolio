                </header>

                <div class="p1">
                    <p>Through the lens of living democracy Australians celebrate the intrinsic spirit of social and political history, in the Museum of Australian Democracy (MoAD). Housed in Australia’s most iconic building Old Parliament House, it protects and exhibits historical film and media, memorials, parliamentary rooms, artists, and illustrations such as political cartoonists.</p>

                    <p>MoAD's latest exhibitions, 'Democracy DNA: People, Prime, Ministers and the World’ and ‘Behind the Lines’, promote two prolific Australian illustrators, Nigel Buchanan, and Cathy Wilcox. These artists magnify the satirical essence of politics and portray former prime Ministers injecting colour and personality.</p>

                    <p>I propose MoAD introduces Augmented Reality (AR) to transform political cartoons and illustrations for future generations. AR is proven to gap the void and build interactive bridges that allow the public to access and experience what the curator intended to get across to the audience in real life. </p>

                    <p>AR dramatically advances the future of MoAD, when visitors enter MoAD they’re invited to use a QR code on their phone or tablet device. The code is specially designed to access AR experiences spotted through both exhibitions, transforming the 2D cartoons and illustrations into 3D interactive works of art.</p>

                    <p>What AR does is support a creative real-world environment with generated perceptual information laid over the top of it to view artists' collections. AR gives illustrator, Nigel Buchanan, interactive benefits to blend digital and three-dimensional components with an individual's perception of the real world. The interactive nature of AR means MoAD has a variety of uses from helping in decision-making to entertainment. </p>

                    <p>AR gives cartoonist, Cathy Wilcox, an ingenious straightforward way to add explanations to her cartoons by placing QR codes alongside her 2020 ‘Behind the Lines’ illustrations displayed in MoAD. AR brings Cathy’s cartoons to life and draws in audiences to interact with and explore the images in a unique and exciting new way.</p>

                        <p>Cathy Wilcox is a renowned Australian cartoonist and illustrator since 1989, best known for her work in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspaper. Among multiple awards spanning her career, she was named ‘Cartoonist of the Year’ in 2009, 2016, and 2020 by MoAD.</p>

                        <p> The piece was an illustration Cathy designed for the 2020 Behind The Lines exhibition titled <strong><italic>'A Dog's Breakfast'</italic></strong>.  
                        A polite way of summing up the effects of 2020 on Australians.

                        <p> MoAD recommended I reach out the Cathy Wilcox for permission to her collection, following this advice, I engaged with Cathy, and she also grant me permission to transform her work. I brought 4 of Cathy's cartoon's together, in an AR display.</p>

                            <p>I engaged with MoAD, seeking approval to use Nigel Buchanan’s illustrations in an AR frame, MoAD grant me permission to use Nigel's collection for my assessment. Nigel Buchanan is an award-winning New Zealand artist, illustrating famous faces for decades. His playful, graphic portraits appear in major publications such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and TIME magazine. As part of MoAD’s latest exhibition, ‘Democracy DNA: People, Prime, Ministers and the World’, Nigel created new portraits of all 30 former prime ministers of Australia</p>

                            <p> Nigel prefers to use his own artisitc design for his head shot. I couldn't resist to make it AR as well, just for a little fun.</p>
